\title{An S4 class for differentially-private mechanisms.}
\description{
A base class for representing output-perturbing mechanisms in differential
privacy. As this class is \code{VIRTUAL} it cannot be instantiated, but it can
be subclassed.

\describe{
\item{\code{sensitivity}}{non-negative scalar numeric target sensitivity. Defaults
to \code{Inf} for use with \code{sensitivitySampler()}.}

\item{\code{target}}{the target non-private function to be privatized, takes lists.
Defaults to a constant function.}

\item{\code{gammaSensitivity}}{\code{NA_real_} if inactive, or scalar in [0,1)
indicating that responses must be RDP with specific confidence.}
