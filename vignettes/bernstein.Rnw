The primary use case of the Bernstein mechanism is releasing real-valued functions on $[0,1]^d$. The typical function released will depend
on an arbitrary sensitive dataset (which could be numeric or otherwise), and after release the function may be evaluated on unlimited points.

If you make use of the mechanism in your work, please consider citing the original paper \texttt{https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04499} in subsequent writeups:

\section{Bernstein Polynomial Approximation}

Like the more common Taylor polynomial approximation, Bernstein approximations of a target function $f:[0,1]^d \to \mathbb{R}$ involve a weighted sum of basis polynomials. We'll refer to these weights as coefficients, and introduce the Bernstein approximation for the simple one-dimensional $d=1$ case. For details on the multidimensional case (implemented in \pck see the reference paper above).

The $k+1$ Bernstein basis polynomials of degree $k$ are defined as $b_{\nu, k}(x)={k \choose \nu} x^\nu (1-x)^{k-\nu}$ for $\nu$ ranging over $0, \ldots, k$. Fixing $\nu$ and for varying $x\in[0,1]$, the basis function corresponds to the probability that $k$ coin tosses results in $\nu$ heads, where the chance of a head is $x$. Taken as a whole, the set of basis functions therefore makes up the entire probability mass for the $Binomial(k,x)$ distribution.

The coefficients of the Bernstein approximation of target $f$ are simply the evaluations of $f$ on the $(k+1)$-point regular grid covering $[0,1]$: at points $\{0, 1/k, \ldots, k/k\}$.

Together, then, $f(x)$ is approximated as $\tilde{f}(x)=\sum_{\nu=0}^k f(\nu/k) b_{\nu,k}(x)$ which can be interpreted as the expectation of $f(X/k)$ for $X\sim Binomial(k, x)$. We note in passing that nice guarantees exist about the closeness of $\tilde{f}$ to $f$, with natural conditions on smoothness of $f$.

\subsection{Example}

To see Bernstein approximation in action in \pck, consider approximating the function $f(x) = x \sin(10 x)$ on $x\in[0,1]$ with
a Bernstein polynomial of degree $k=25$.

<<example1-1, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'>>=
library(diffpriv)
targetF <- function(x) x * sin(10 * x)
bernsteinF <- bernstein(targetF, dims = 1, k = 25)
@

The returned value is an \code{S3} object of class \code{bernstein}, a list with various slots including one that holds the $k+1$ coefficients of the approximation.

<<example1-2, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'>>=
bernsteinF$coeffs
@

Predictions $\tilde{f}(x)$ can be made for objects of type \code{bernstein} using the \code{predict.bernstein()} function implementing the \code{S3} generic \code{predict()}.

<<example1-3, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'>>=
predict(bernsteinF, D = 0.2)   # approximate f(0.5)
targetF(0.2)                   # actual f(0.5)
@

Evaluation on a collection of points is also easy.

\section{Differential Privacy with the Bernstein Mechanism}

The \code{S4} class \code{DPMechBernstein} subclasses the virtual \code{DPMech} within the \pck package, implementing the generic Bernstein mechanism. The mechanism

\begin{itemize}
\item First instantiates the target function, itself a function of sensitive input data (such as a classifier or statistical model).
\item It then forms a Bernstein polynomial approximation as described above.
\item The Laplace mechanism~\citep{dwork2006calibrating} \code{DPMechLaplace} is used to perturb the Bernstein approximation coefficients. As these are the only component of the approximation that depends on the target function (and hence input dataset; the basis polynomials are target/data-independent), this is sufficient for preserving differential privacy~\citep{dwork2006calibrating}.
\item Subsequent evaluations of the perturbed approximation function are simply sums of the basis polynomials, weighted by these perturbed coefficients.
\end{itemize}

A sufficient level of Laplace noise depends on the global sensitivity of the target function, required as an argument to \code{DPMechBernstein} construction unless the sensitivity sampler is used (demonstrated in the example below). Intuitively, targets that are more volatile---vary more with perturbed input data---require more smoothing by Laplace noise.

\subsection{Example}

Suppose we want to fit a sensitive dataset \code{D} with  Priestly-Chao kernel regression, using the Gaussian kernel with a \code{bandwidth} hyperparameter specifying kernel smoothness. For simplicity, we'll consider a single co-variate. A fitting function for the estimator is given as follows. It takes code{D} a 2-column matrix with examples in rows, and returns a function for making predictions on new data.

<<example2-1, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'>>=
pck_regression <- function(D, bandwidth = 0.1) {
  K <- function(x) exp(-x^2/2)
  ids <- sort(D[,1], decreasing = FALSE, index.return = TRUE)$ix
  D <- D[ids, ]
  n <- nrow(D)
  ws <- (D[2:n,1] - D[1:(n-1),1]) * D[2:n,2]
  predictor <- function(x) {
    sum(ws * sapply((x - D[2:n,1]) / bandwidth, K)) / bandwidth
  }
  return(predictor)
}
@

We have the following (synthetic) sensitive dataset, as a $250\times 2$ matrix with the first column representing co-variates/features and the second column representing dependent variables/labels.

<<example2-2, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'>>=
N <- 250
D <- runif(N)
D <- cbind(D, sin(D*10)*D + rnorm(N, mean=0, sd=0.2))
@

Let's fit three models for comparison:

\begin{itemize}
\item A non-private exact Priestly-Chao regression given by \code{model};
\item A non-private Bernstein approximation of the exact regression \code{bmodel}; and
\item A privatized regression produced by \code{DPMechBernstein}, \code{pmodel}.
\end{itemize}

<<example2-3, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'>>=
## Non private fitting
model <- pck_regression(D)

## Bernstein non private fitting
K <- 25
bmodel <- bernstein(model, dims=1, k=K)

## Private Bernstein fitting
m <- DPMechBernstein(target=pck_regression, latticeK=K, dims=1)
P <- function(n) {  # a sampler of random, "plausible", datasets
  Dx <- runif(n)
  Dy <- rep(0, n)
  if (runif(1) < 0.95) Dy <- Dy + Dx
  if (runif(1) < 0.5) Dy <- Dy * sin(Dx)
  if (runif(1) < 0.5) Dy <- Dy * cos(Dx)
  cbind(Dx, Dy + rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=0.2))
}
m <- sensitivitySampler(m, oracle=P, n=N, gamma=0.20, m=500)
R <- releaseResponse(m, privacyParams=DPParamsEps(epsilon=5), X=D)
pmodel <- R$response
@

The private model is produced as described above. \code{sensitivitySampler()} probes the non-private model with $500$ random pairs of datasets, sampled from \code{P()}, to estimate the target's sensitivity. The resulting perturbed private model preserves random differential privacy with level $\epsilon=5$ and confidence $\gamma=0.2$. In practice we could easily take $\gamma$ much smaller (much higher confidence) by increasing sensitivity sample size \code{m}.

Let's now take our three fitted models, and predict the dependent variable/label across a range of covariates/features.

<<example2-4, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'>>=
xs <- seq(from=0, to=1, length=50)
yhats   <- sapply(xs, model)
yhats.b <- predict(bmodel, xs)
yhats.p <- R$response(xs)
@

We can now finally visually compare the three fitted models, alongside the original training dataset.

<<example2-5, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup', fig.show='hold', fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5, fig.cap = "Kernel regression on 1D training data (gray points): non-private model (red dashed); non-private Bernstein polynomial approximation (black dotted); private Bernstein mechanism (blue solid).">>=
xlim <- c(0, 1)
ylim <- range(c(yhats.b, yhats.p, yhats, D[,2]))
plot(D, pch=20, cex=0.6, xlim=c(0,1), ylim=ylim, xlab="X", ylab="Y",
    main="Priestly-Chao Kernel Regression", col="lightgrey")
lines(xs, yhats.p, col="blue",  type="l", lty="solid", lwd = 2)
lines(xs, yhats.b, col="black", type="l", lty="dotted", lwd = 3)
lines(xs, yhats,   col="red",   type="l", lty="dashed", lwd =2)
@

We could safely release the model \code{pmodel} but not the other non-private models. Also note that while a target's sensitivity can be computed/bounded manually in many cases, when the target is more complex sensitivity analysis can be prohibative. The sensitivity sampler offers a pragmatic approach to such situations, replacing exact bounds with random probing and estimation. For the resulting random differential privacy to make sense, the sampling distribution (passed as argument `oracle` to the sensitivity sampler) should reflect public knowledge about the dataset. This could be noninformative (like a uniform/normal distribution), it could be a public Bayesian prior, it could even be the result of density estimation on a real dataset (potentially privately estimated).
